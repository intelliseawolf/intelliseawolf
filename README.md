As a seasoned Full Stack Software Engineer, I bring to the table a comprehensive expertise in multiple programming languages and technologies, seamlessly integrating my technical skills with robust CI/CD practices and AWS deployment to sculpt, refine, and secure web applications and platforms.

😍 I am open for collaborating on open source and large & small projects and love for connecting with the other engineers.
