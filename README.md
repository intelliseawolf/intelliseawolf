# 👋 @intelliseawolf<br>

I am a senior full stack software engineer, mainly focused on the frontend, with strong skills and rich experience in website and mobile development. I enjoy new challenges, looking to overcome my own high standard goals. I am following modern trends of the web and mobile development and trying to help the project grow and fix their UI / UX problems in design.

For the last 8+ years, I specialized in modern frameworks and libraries such as React, Next.js, Vue.js, Node.js, Laravel, Django, and ROR and built small & large-scale websites, customized components and modules etc.

In addition, I am familiar with teamwork and experienced in working as a remote developer. I am looking for challenging and big projects and will provide a high-quality and well-structured code to customers.
Feel free to reach out to me, I am always open to discussions and glad to help!

Thanks!
